# Vehicle-Trajectory-Mining-Using-Object-Detection
This is a object tracking project which includes in detecting the objects with yolo v5 which is a pre trained model with coco dataset
in this we use deep sort algorithm to track the objects that we detect using yolo v5
we use a counter function to count the number of vehicles passing the junction by drawing a line on video that will be given as input ,this was done by using open cv
install requirements via " pip install -r requirements.txt "
run track.py to detect the objects and count , this was uploaded in streamlit(a web application) , run via streamlit run track.py
